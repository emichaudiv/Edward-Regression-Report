Goal: Predicting property tax in 2017
Description: Using a Dataset from zillow, it shall be cleaned up and filtered for single family properties.
Layout: I would extract from the Zillow database and check the properties_2017 table and check the essential columns for the project
Hypothesis: Larger houses with 1 bathroom would be worth less than a smaller house with two bathrooms.
Data Dictionary: df= Data Frame, x/y train = independant variables used for the model, x/y test = variables used for testing, mean = average of dataset, RMSE = Root Mean square Division, used to predict with data set
Instructions:Assuming you have access with your env.py, adjust the numbers with what is desired and the Graphs to what is needed
Takeaways: While mostly barren, the more bathrooms a property has, the more its value will rise, applicable to bedrooms, but more so with bathrooms.
